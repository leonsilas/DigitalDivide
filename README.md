# DigitalDivide
Digital Divide is a continuous software developed by mutliple classes in Valencia College's CTSD program. Focused on branching the divide between the people of Orlando and technology, the software is designed to pull geojson census data (that must be added personally into the assets) and then filter it to create workable data to display on a map.
